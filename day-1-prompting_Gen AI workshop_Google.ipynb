You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

It was a world filled with rustling leaves, chirping birds, and a most enticing scent of… something delicious. This, Bartholomew decided, was the day for adventure.\n\nHe squeezed through the gap between the window and the curtain, a feat achieved only with much hissing and a generous dose of feline acrobatics. The garden, with its vibrant flowers and sun-drenched paths, was a sensory overload. He stalked a particularly plump bumblebee, only to be met with a stinging surprise, which he promptly shook off with a haughty flick of his tail.\n\nHis journey led him to a sprawling field, a symphony of green and gold. There, under the watchful gaze of a giant oak, he encountered a family of rabbits. They were adorable, he conceded, particularly the one with the floppy ears.  He stalked them, a hunter by instinct, only to be met with a flurry of white tails as they disappeared into their burrow.\n\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the field, Bartholomew found himself facing a formidable opponent – a dog, a very large and boisterous dog. The dog, who had been snoozing under the oak, looked at Bartholomew with curiosity. Their eyes met, and in that silent communication, Bartholomew sensed something different. This dog, he realized, was not an enemy. \n\nThe dog, whose name was Sparky, was a gentle giant, and the two of them spent the rest of the evening playing in the golden light.  They chased each other through the tall grass, Sparky’s happy barks echoing through the field. \n\nAs the moon replaced the sun, Bartholomew decided it was time to go home. He had had enough excitement for one day.  With a lingering glance at Sparky, he turned and headed back towards the familiar scent of home. \n\nHe slipped back through the window, his fur dusted with leaves and a hint of grass, a satisfied purr rumbling in his chest. The world outside was a world of wonders, but home, he knew, was where the warmest lap and the tastiest tuna resided. And that, he thought, was an adventure worth repeating. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.
